Step 1: what is an API
Application Programming Interface

cross platform , anyone can call it.

2 types of API
rest api / restful api set of rule

rest API:
1. server-to-client /client to server
   html/React ajax from client to request server for data processing
DATA output must in xml or json
2. json/xml
    data must be in xml or json formate
    json
    [
        {
            asd:as
        },
        {
            asd:123
        }
    ]
    xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <note>
        <to>Tove</to>
        <from>Jani</from>
        <heading>Reminder</heading>
        <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
    </note>

//work
The Book
http verbs

GET  //fetch data
POST // save data 
PUT/PATCH //update
DELETE //delete 

Architecture

Good Practice

1. Controller  
2. Model   //database schema table fields book (title,desciption,author)
3. Routes  //end-points /get /post/ put and delete
index.js  //Controller,routes set in return to server
server.js  //enter point start of app
.env   //port number in | email
